Desc:
You are given an integer n. Return all well-formed parentheses strings that you can generate with n pairs of parentheses.

Solution:
def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
    - have to backtrack and check with this sequence:
        - if opened == closed == n: add this str to res list
        - if opened < n => backtrack(opened+1, closed)
        - if closed < opened => backtrack(opened, closed+1)
    - start with backtrack(0,0)
