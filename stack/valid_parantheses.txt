Desc:
You are given a string s consisting of the following characters: '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'.
The input string s is valid if and only if:
- Every open bracket is closed by the same type of close bracket.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Return true if s is a valid string, and false otherwise.

Solution:
def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
    - init hashMap: {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["} and empty stack
    - if opening bracket => push to stack
    - else if stack is empty or top element of stack is not equal to current char => return False
    - else pop the current element from stack
    - if stack is empty => return True
