Desc:
You are given an array of integers heights where heights[i] represents the height of a bar. The width of each bar is 1.
Return the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed among the bars.

Solution:
def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
    - init stack of pairs (index, height)
    - if current elem is >= than top elems from stack
        - means we can extend the potential max area and just append to stack
    - else if current elem is less than top elems from stack
        - we can't extend area starting from top stack
        - we pop elements from stack until the top is <= current element
            - while popping we compute max area
        - and we append current elem to stack with the last popped elem's index
            - because technically current element can start from the last popped index, like 5,6,2 => 2 can start from 5th index
    - if there are left elems in stack
        - we have to check them to find potential max area
