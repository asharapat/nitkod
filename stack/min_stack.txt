Desc:
Design a stack class that supports the push, pop, top, and getMin operations.
- MinStack() initializes the stack object.
- void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
- void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
- int top() gets the top element of the stack.
- int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
Each function should run in O(1) time.

Solution:
    - we have to create 2 stacks: stack and minStack
    - basic logic to push to minStack:
        - if minStack is empty => just save the value
        - if minStack is not empty => compare pushed value with the minStack's top value -> minVal
        - and push the minVal to minStack
