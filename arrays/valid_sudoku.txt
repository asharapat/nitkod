Desc:
You are given a a 9 x 9 Sudoku board board. A Sudoku board is valid if the following rules are followed:
- Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
- Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
- Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.

Return true if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return false

Note: A board does not need to be full or be solvable to be valid.

Solution:
def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
    - maintain 3 list of sets:
     - 1 for each row
     - 1 for each column
     - 1 for 3x3 grid
    - check each element if its already in corresponding set
    - like: board[r][c] in rows[r] or board[r][c] in cols[c] or board[r][c] in squares[(r//3, c//3)]
    - squares[(r//3, c//3)] has key of pairs, including: 0,1,2; // means floor
    - append current element to all corresponding sets
