Desc:
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings
The string can contain any UTF-8 symbols

Solution:
def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
    - encode in way: first is length of each word, then '#' and then word itself: 4#word5#wor#d

def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
    - find the length first -> string until the first '#'
    - append the string starting from '#' until the length
    - return the list of strings
