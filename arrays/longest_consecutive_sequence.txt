Desc:
Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements.
A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element.

Solution:
def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    - track all nums to hashset
    - check if num-1 is not in hashset, so that current num is the beginning of sequence
    - if it is, then count all num+1's, if they are in hashset
    - when stopped -> update the max length
