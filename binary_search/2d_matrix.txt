Desc:
You are given an m x n 2-D integer array matrix and an integer target.
- Each row in matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of every row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Return true if target exists within matrix or false otherwise.

Solution:
def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
    - first try to find proper row ->
        - if target is greater than the last elem of row => go down
        - if target is less than the first elem of the row => go up
    - then apply binary search to the row
