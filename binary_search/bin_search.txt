Desc:
You are given an array of distinct integers nums, sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.
Implement a function to search for target within nums. If it exists, then return its index, otherwise, return -1.
Your solution must run in O(logn) time.

Solution:
def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    - classic bin search solution :D
