Desc:
You are given an integer array heights where heights[i] represents the height of the i'th bar.
You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Solution:
def maxArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
    - init 2 pointers: l, r = 0, len(heights)-1
    - loop while l < r and check: mx = max(mx, (r-l)*min(heights[l], heights[r]))
    - then do corresponding increment of l and r depending on heights[l] <> heights[r]
