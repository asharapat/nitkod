Desc:
Design a data structure that supports adding new words and searching for existing words.
Implement the WordDictionary class:
- void addWord(word) Adds word to the data structure.
- bool search(word) Returns true if there is any string in the data structure that matches 
  word or false otherwise. word may contain dots '.' where dots can be matched with any letter.

Solution:

"Add" is similar to standard insert method of Trie

def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
    - we have to iterate through word
    - if char is letter => just check it in standard way
    - if char is "." => call dfs to remaining part of word and cur.children
