Desc:
You are given an array nums of integers, which may contain duplicates. 
Return all possible subsets.
The solution must not contain duplicate subsets. You may return the solution in any order.

Solution:
def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    - the solution is similar to subset problem:
    - have 2 choices:
        - add current element and call dfs(i+1, subset)
        - pop current element and check:
            - while nums[i] == nums[i+1]: i += 1
        - only after that call dfs(i+1, subset)
        - this will guarantee that we don't consider the same element several times
