Desc:
Given a string s, split s into substrings where every substring is a palindrome. 
Return all possible lists of palindromic substrings.

Solution:
def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
    - example: aab
    - loop through substrings like -> a, aa, aab and call dfs for remaining part of the str
    - the decision tree:
               aab
        *a        *aa      aab
      *a   ab      *b
    *b
