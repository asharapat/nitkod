Desc:
You are given two integer arrays preorder and inorder.
Rebuild the binary tree from the preorder and inorder traversals and return its root.

Solution:
def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    - preorder[0] is the root
    - mid = inorder.index(preorder[0]) is our delimiter meaning:
        - all elements left to mid in inorder are in left subtree
        - all elements right to mid inorder are in right subtree
        - all elements from [1:mid+1] in preorder are in left subtree
        - all elements from [mid+1:] in preopder are in right subtree
