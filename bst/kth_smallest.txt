Desc:
Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) in the tree.

Solution:
def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
    - iterative inorder dfs
    - go left and add elems to stack
    - after we reach leftmost => start processing elems from stack
    - whenever we process current elem => do k -=1 and return current elem if k == 0
