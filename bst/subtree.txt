Desc:
Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.
A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Solution:
 def isSubtree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], subRoot: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    - have to solve the same tree problem first and use it here
    - if root and subRoot are the same => true
    - else compare root.left and root.right subtrees with subRoot
    - if either one of them is equal to subRoot => true
