Desc:
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, return true if the trees are equivalent, otherwise return false.
Two binary trees are considered equivalent if they share the exact same structure and the nodes have the same values.

Solution:
def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    - use dfs to check these cases:
        - if both are null => true
        - if only one of them is null => false
        - if vals are different => false
        - if left and right subtrees are the same => true else false
