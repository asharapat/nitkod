Desc:
Given a binary tree root, return the level order traversal of it as a nested list, where each sublist contains the values of nodes at a particular level in the tree, from left to right.

Solution:
def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
    - use bfs
    - if queue is not empty:
        - take elements from queue
        - add their vals to resList
        - add their children to queue
