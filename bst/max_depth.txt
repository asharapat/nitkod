Desc:
Given the root of a binary tree, return its depth.
The depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Solution:
def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    - get the height of both childs and return max(left, right) + 1
    - if null node => return 0
