Desc:
Within a binary tree, a node x is considered good if the path from the root of the tree to the node x contains no nodes with a value greater than the value of node x
Given the root of a binary tree root, return the number of good nodes within the tree.

Solution:
def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
    - use preorder travers
    - if node >= mx => res = 1
    - update the mx
    - add to res returned value from left side and right side
