Given a binary tree, return true if it is height-balanced and false otherwise.
A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

Solution:
def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    - solution is similar to max_depth
    - if node is null => 0
    - do postorder to left and right child
    - then update the max difference between left and right
    - return max(left, right) + 1 for current node
    - if max diff < 2 => True, else False
