Desc:
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists into one sorted linked list and return the head of the new sorted linked list.
The new list should be made up of nodes from list1 and list2.

Solution:
def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    - create a dummy node and one pointer: p = dummy
    - compare list1.val and list2.val
        - assign the less to p.next
        - move the less
        - move the p
    - don't forget to check if either of the lists are not null and add not null to the end of the p
