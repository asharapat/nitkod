Desc:
You are given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers. Each integer in nums is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
Every integer appears exactly once, except for one integer which appears two or more times. Return the integer that appears more than once.

Solution:
def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    - take the current num as index and mark nums[current] as negative
    - if there is already a negative marked number => return current
