Desc:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Solution:
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
    - init a hashSet, max and left pointer
    - loop through the string
    - while the letter is already in our set:
        - move the left pointer
        - before moving it, remove this left letter from the set
    - else:
        - add the letter to set
        - update the max
