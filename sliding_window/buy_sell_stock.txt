Desc:
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of NeetCoin on the ith day.
You may choose a single day to buy one NeetCoin and choose a different day in the future to sell it.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve. You may choose to not make any transactions, in which case the profit would be 0.

Solution:
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    - take 2 pointers lowest, price = 0, 1
    - loop the list while price < len(prices)*
    - if price < lowest => lowest = price
    - else => update the max and price++

* - if we reach the end of the list, that means our prices were higher than 
    the lowest price. So there is no point to look for another lowest price
